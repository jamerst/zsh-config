# zsh-config (ARCHIVED)

This was used to store my personal config for zsh, but it was a pain to use and only had stuff for zsh. It has been replaced by [jamerst/dotfiles](https://github.com/jamerst/dotfiles), which is symlink based, has an automatic install script, and has configs for more things all in one repository.
